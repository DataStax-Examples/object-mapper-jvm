# Object mapper in alternative JVM tools and languages

The [Java DataStax Driver](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/) comes with an
object mapper that removes boilerplate of writing queries and lets you focus on your application
objects. This example shows how to use the mapper with various "alternative" JVM tools and
languages.

See each subdirectory for more explanations.

Note that a "standard" example using vanilla Java and Maven is also available
[here](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/object-mapper-java).
